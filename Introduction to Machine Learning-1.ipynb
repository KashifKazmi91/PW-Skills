    "or clusters.\n",
    "   - By learning what \"normal\" behavior looks like, the model can then detect instances that deviate significantly\n",
    "    from this established norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Clustering algorithms, such as K-Means or DBSCAN, group similar data points together.\n",
    "   - Anomalies can be identified as points that do not fit well into any of the clusters or are in sparsely populated \n",
    "    regions of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Density Estimation**:\n",
    "   - Algorithms like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) estimate the probability density function of the data.\n",
    "   - Anomalies can be detected as points that fall in low-density regions, indicating that they are rare or unexpected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:\n",
    "   - Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE can reduce the dimensionality of the data while \n",
    "retaining important features.\n",
    "   - Anomalies may be identified as points that are far from the main distribution of data in the reduced space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Autoencoders**:\n",
    "   - Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning.\n",
    "   - They learn to compress (encode) and then reconstruct (decode) the data. Anomalies can be detected by measuring \n",
    "    the reconstruction error: if the error is significantly higher for a data point, it may indicate that the point \n",
