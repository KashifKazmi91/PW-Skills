    "\n",
    "### Calculation of R-squared\n",
    "R-squared is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "[R^2 = 1 - {SS_{res}}/{SS_{tot}}]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- ( SS_{res}) (the residual sum of squares) is the sum of the squares of the residuals (the differences between the \n",
    "observed values and the values predicted by the model).\n",
    "- ( SS_{tot}) (the total sum of squares) is the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed values and \n",
    "the mean of the observed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, these sums of squares can be defined as:\n",
    "- ( SS_{res} = sum (y_i - hat{y}_i)^2)\n",
    "- ( SS_{tot} = sum (y_i - bar{y})^2)\n",

    "- ( y_i ) are the observed values,\n",
    "- ( hat{y}_i ) are the predicted values from the model,\n",
    "- ( \\bar{y} ) is the mean of the observed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value Range**: R-squared values range from 0 to 1.\n",
    "  - An R-squared of 0 indicates that the independent variable(s) do not explain any of the variability in the dependent \n",
    "variable.\n",
    "  - An R-squared of 1 indicates that the independent variable(s) explain all the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proportion of Variance Explained**: R-squared represents the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable \n",

    "### Key Differences Between R-squared and Adjusted R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adjustment for Number of Predictors**:\n",
    "   - **R-squared**: As more independent variables are added to a model, R-squared never decreases; it either increases \n",
    "    or stays the same. This can lead to overfitting, where the model appears to perform better simply because it has \n",
    "    more predictors, regardless of their relevance.\n",
    "   - **Adjusted R-squared**: This metric adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It can decrease if adding \n",
    "    a new predictor does not improve the model sufficiently, providing a more realistic assessment of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formula**:\n",
    "   - The formula for adjusted R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "[text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - left( {SS_{res}/(n - k - 1)}/{SS_{tot}/(n - 1)} right)]\n",

    "   - ( n ) is the number of observations,\n",
    "   - ( k ) is the number of predictors in the model.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This adjustment means that as you add more predictors, the penalty for adding predictors is incorporated into the \n",
    "    calculation, which is why it can decrease if the new variable does not contribute meaningfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - **R-squared** indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model but does not consider the number of \n",

    "   - **Adjusted R-squared** gives a more nuanced view of model fit by taking into account the complexity of the model. \n",

    "   - **Ridge**: Uses L2 norm (squared values), resulting in coefficient shrinkage without eliminating any variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - **Lasso**: Results in simpler models with fewer predictors, making it easier to interpret.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Penalty on Coefficient Size**: Regularization techniques like Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge \n",

    "    the model's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reducing Variance**: Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise in the training data rather than the underlying \n",
    "    patterns. Regularization reduces the variance of the model by limiting the influence of any single feature, which \n",
    "    is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional spaces where the risk of overfitting is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sparsity and Feature Selection**: Lasso regularization, in particular, can shrink some coefficients to zero, \n",
    "    leading to a simpler model that only includes the most important features, further reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Predicting House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're developing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square \n",
    "footage, number of bedrooms, location, age of the property, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Without Regularization**:\n",
    "   - If you include all features without regularization, the model may fit the training data very closely, capturing \n",
    "noise along with the underlying trend. This could lead to a model that performs well on the training set but poorly \n",
    "on a validation set (overfitting).\n",
    "   - For example, if you have 50 features, the model might learn specific details about the training data that don’t \n",
    "    generalize, like an unusual price drop in a specific neighborhood that isn't reflective of the overall market.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **With Regularization**:\n",
    "   - If you apply Lasso regularization, the penalty term encourages some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively \n",
    "eliminating less important features. This leads to a more interpretable model that focuses on the most significant \n",
    "predictors.\n",
    "   - Ridge regularization, on the other hand, will reduce the magnitude of all coefficients but retain all features, \n",
    "    stabilizing the model against multicollinearity and noisy data.\n",
    "   - Both regularization methods would likely result in improved performance on the validation set, indicating better \n",
    "generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the effectiveness of regularization:\n",

    "### Which Model to Choose?\n",
    "\n",

    "  - If the goal is to minimize the average error, Model B (MAE = 8) is preferable because it has a lower error metric \n",

    "- **Sensitivity to Outliers**: RMSE is sensitive to outliers, meaning that if Model A has a few significant errors, \n",
    "    it could disproportionately impact the performance measure. In contrast, MAE could provide a more robust assessment\n",
    "    in the presence of outliers.\n",

    "### Comparison of Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model A (Ridge with \\(\\lambda = 0.1\\))**:\n",
    "   - Ridge regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. \n",
    "    This encourages small coefficients and can help stabilize predictions, especially in the presence of \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Model B (Lasso with \\(\\lambda = 0.5\\))**:\n",
    "   - Lasso regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute values of the coefficients. This can shrink some \n",
    "    coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection and simplifying the model.\n",
    "   - If the regularization parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) is relatively high (like 0.5), Lasso may eliminate less important \n",
    "features, leading to a sparser and potentially more interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Model to Choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Considerations**:\n",
    "  - **Feature Importance**: If you have a large number of features and suspect that only a few are truly important, \n",
    "    Model B (Lasso) may be preferable due to its ability to reduce the number of predictors and enhance interpretability.\n",
    "  - **Multicollinearity**: If your dataset has multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors), \n",
    "    Model A (Ridge) may perform better because it tends to distribute the coefficient weights among correlated \n",
    "    features rather than selecting one arbitrarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensitivity to Parameter Choice**:\n",
    "   - The regularization parameters (\\(\\lambda\\)) play a crucial role in model performance. Choosing a suboptimal \n",
    "\\(\\lambda\\) can lead to underfitting (if too large) or overfitting (if too small). Both models require careful tuning \n",
    "of these parameters, often through cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretability**:\n",
    "   - While Lasso may provide a simpler model with fewer predictors, the interpretation of the coefficients can still \n",
    "be complex, especially if interactions between features exist or if the model is trained on highly correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias-Variance Trade-off**:\n",
    "   - Ridge tends to have lower bias and higher variance, while Lasso may reduce variance at the cost of introducing \n",
    "some bias due to feature elimination. The optimal choice depends on the specific context and what is more critical \n",
    "for the analysis (predictive accuracy vs. interpretability).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance with Highly Correlated Features**:\n",
    "   - In cases with highly correlated features, Lasso might randomly choose one predictor over another, which could \n",
    "lead to a loss of valuable information. Ridge, by contrast, retains all predictors but may distribute weights across \n",
    "them."
