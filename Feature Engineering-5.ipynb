    "**Ordinal Encoding** and **Label Encoding** are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical form,\n",
    "but they are used in different contexts based on the nature of the categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Ordinal encoding is used for categorical variables that have a meaningful order or ranking among \n",
    "    their categories. Each category is assigned a unique integer based on its rank.\n",
    "- **Example**: Consider a variable representing customer satisfaction with values such as \"Poor,\" \"Fair,\" \"Good,\" \n",
    "    and \"Excellent.\" You might encode these as:\n",
    "  - Poor: 1\n",
    "  - Fair: 2\n",
    "  - Good: 3\n",
    "  - Excellent: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Ordinal encoding is appropriate when the order of categories is significant and can influence the \n",
    "    model's predictions. For example, in a customer satisfaction survey, the numerical values assigned indicate \n",
    "    increasing levels of satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category in a categorical variable without implying\n",
    "    any order. This technique is commonly used for nominal variables where categories do not have a meaningful order.\n",
    "- **Example**: Consider a variable representing different animal species such as \"Dog,\" \"Cat,\" and \"Bird.\" You might \n",
    "    encode these as:\n",
    "  - Dog: 0\n",
    "  - Cat: 1\n",
    "  - Bird: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Label encoding is suitable for nominal data where the categories are distinct and do not have any\n",
    "    ordinal relationship. For instance, in a dataset describing different species of animals, the encoded \n",
    "    integers merely serve as identifiers and do not carry any ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Choose One Over the Other\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Ordinal Encoding When**:\n",
    "  - The categorical variable has a natural order.\n",
    "  - The relationships between categories are meaningful and can affect the outcome.\n",
    "  - Example: Customer feedback categories like \"Very Unsatisfied,\" \"Unsatisfied,\" \"Neutral,\" \"Satisfied,\" \n",
    "    \"Very Satisfied.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Label Encoding When**:\n",
    "  - The categorical variable has no intrinsic order.\n",
    "  - The categories are distinct and unrelated.\n",
    "  - Example: Colors like \"Red,\" \"Green,\" \"Blue,\" where assigning a numerical value does not imply any ranking.\n"

    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding** is a technique used to encode categorical variables by considering the relationship\n",
    "between the categorical variable and the target variable. This approach helps to maintain the ordinal nature of the \n",
    "categories while incorporating the target variable's influence, leading to more informative numerical representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Target Guided Ordinal Encoding Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Target Mean**: For each category in the categorical variable, calculate the mean (or median) of the \n",
    "    target variable. This average reflects how each category relates to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assign Numeric Values**: Replace the categories with the calculated mean values. The categories will be \n",
    "    represented by their corresponding target means, effectively ranking them based on their association with the\n",
    "    target.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retain Order**: By encoding categories based on their target means, this method ensures that categories that\n",
    "    lead to higher target values receive higher numerical representations, preserving the ordinal aspect of the \n",
    "    variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: Imagine you are working on a project to predict house prices based on various features, including the\n",
    "    categorical feature \"Neighborhood,\" which has categories like \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" and \"D.\" You also have a continuous\n",
    "    target variable: house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Mean House Prices**:\n",
    "   - Neighborhood A: Mean Price = $300,000\n",
    "   - Neighborhood B: Mean Price = $400,000\n",
    "   - Neighborhood C: Mean Price = $350,000\n",
    "   - Neighborhood D: Mean Price = $250,000\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assign Numeric Values**:\n",
    "   - Replace the \"Neighborhood\" categories with their corresponding mean prices:\n",
    "     - Neighborhood A: 300,000\n",
    "     - Neighborhood B: 400,000\n",
    "     - Neighborhood C: 350,000\n",
    "     - Neighborhood D: 250,000\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformed Dataset**:\n",
    "   - The original dataset might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | Neighborhood | House Price |\n",
    "   |--------------|-------------|\n",
    "   | A            | 320,000     |\n",
    "   | B            | 450,000     |\n",
    "   | C            | 370,000     |\n",
    "   | D            | 240,000     |\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After target guided ordinal encoding, it would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   | Neighborhood (Encoded) | House Price |\n",
    "   |------------------------|-------------|\n",
    "   | 300,000                | 320,000     |\n",
    "   | 400,000                | 450,000     |\n",

    "   | 250,000                | 240,000     |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "You might consider using target guided ordinal encoding in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Categorical Variable is Nominal but has a Relationship with the Target**: When the categorical variable \n",
    "    does not have an inherent order, but the relationship with the target can help to inform the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When You Want to Preserve Information**: It retains more information than simple label encoding and can improve\n",
    "    the performance of certain models that are sensitive to the numeric values of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Case**: In a customer churn prediction model, you could use target guided ordinal encoding for a\n",
    "    categorical feature like \"Subscription Type\" (e.g., \"Basic,\" \"Standard,\" \"Premium\") where the churn rates \n",
    "    (your target variable) differ significantly between the types. By encoding based on churn rates, you help the\n",
    "    model understand the impact of subscription type on churn, potentially leading to better predictions.\n"

    "### Definition of Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance** is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two random variables change together. \n",
    "If the variables tend to increase and decrease together, they have a positive covariance. Conversely, if one variable\n",
    "tends to increase when the other decreases, the covariance is negative. A covariance of zero suggests that the variables\n",
    "are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Covariance in Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Relationships**: Covariance helps in understanding the relationship between two variables. \n",
    "    It indicates whether changes in one variable might result in changes in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Foundation for Correlation**: Covariance is a fundamental concept that underpins correlation. While covariance\n",
    "    provides a measure of directional relationship, correlation normalizes this value to a scale of -1 to +1, \n",
    "    making it easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Portfolio Management**: In finance, covariance is used to assess the relationship between the returns of \n",
    "    different assets. This helps in diversification strategies to minimize risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Selection**: In machine learning, analyzing the covariance between features can help in selecting \n",
    "    relevant features, as highly correlated features may provide redundant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation of Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance can be calculated using the following formula for two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) are the individual sample points of variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n",
    "- \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\) are the mean values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively.\n",
    "- \\(n\\) is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find the Means**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the mean of \\(X\\) and the mean of \\(Y\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Deviations**:\n",
    "   - For each pair of observations, calculate the deviation of each value from its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiply Deviations**:\n",
    "   - Multiply the deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) for each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sum the Products**:\n",
    "   - Sum all the products obtained in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Divide by \\(n-1\\)**:\n",
    "   - Finally, divide the sum by \\(n-1\\) to get the covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the following dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| X | Y |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| 2 | 3 |\n",
    "| 4 | 5 |\n",
    "| 6 | 7 |\n",
    "| 8 | 9 |\n",
