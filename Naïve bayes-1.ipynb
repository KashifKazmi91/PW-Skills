    "when to use each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - **Use When**: The features are continuous and assumed to follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",
    "   - **Example**: This classifier is suitable for datasets where features such as heights, weights, or measurements \n",
    "    are continuous.\n",
    "   - **How It Works**: It calculates the probability of each feature using the mean and variance, assuming that \n",
    "    features are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - **Use When**: The features are discrete counts or frequencies, commonly used in text classification tasks.\n",
    "   - **Example**: This classifier is appropriate for problems like spam detection or sentiment analysis where the \n",
    "    features represent word counts or term frequencies.\n",
    "   - **How It Works**: It uses the multinomial distribution to model the likelihood of each feature given a class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - **Use When**: The features are binary (0 or 1), indicating the presence or absence of a feature.\n",
    "   - **Example**: This is suitable for text classification where the features indicate whether a word appears in a\n",
    "    document or not.\n",
    "   - **How It Works**: It assumes that each feature is independent and follows a Bernoulli distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nature of Features**:\n",
    "   - Continuous features suggest Gaussian Naive Bayes.\n",
    "   - Discrete counts point to Multinomial Naive Bayes.\n",
    "   - Binary features indicate Bernoulli Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Distribution**:\n",
    "   - Assess whether your data fits the assumptions of normality (Gaussian) for continuous features or whether features\n",
    "are count-based (Multinomial) or binary (Bernoulli).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Problem Domain**:\n",
    "   - Consider the specific context of the problem and the types of data commonly used in similar applications. \n",
    "For example, text data typically uses Multinomial or Bernoulli Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - After selecting a classifier, evaluate its performance using cross-validation or a hold-out validation set. \n",
