    "1. Mean:\n",
    "   - Definition: The average of all data points, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.\n",

    "2. Median:\n",
    "   - Definition: The middle value when the data points are ordered from smallest to largest. If there’s an even number \n",
    "of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "   - Usage: The median is useful in skewed distributions or when outliers are present, as it better represents the \n",
    "central tendency in such cases.\n",
    "   - Example: For the scores [70, 80, 90, 100, 110], the median is 90. \n",
    "For [70, 80, 90, 100], it is \\( \\frac{80 + 90}{2} = 85 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode:\n",
    "   - Definition: The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "   - Usage: The mode is useful for categorical data or to identify the most common item in a dataset.\n",
    "   - Example: In the dataset [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], the mode is 2. In categorical data like [red, blue, blue, green], \n",
    "the mode is \"blue.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability\n",
    "These measures indicate how spread out or dispersed the data points are.\n",
    "1. Range:\n",
    "   - Definition: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Usage: The range provides a simple measure of variability but does not account for the distribution of the data \n",
    "points.\n",
    "   - Example: For the dataset [5, 10, 15], the range is \\( 15 - 5 = 10 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance:\n",
    "   - Definition: The average of the squared differences from the mean. It measures how far each number in the dataset \n",
    "is from the mean.\n",
    "   - Usage: Variance quantifies the spread of the data points; a higher variance indicates that data points are more \n",
    "spread out from the mean.\n",
    "   - Example: For the scores [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9], the variance helps to understand how dispersed these values \n",
    "are.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation:\n",
    "   - Definition: The square root of the variance, representing the average distance of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "   - Usage: The standard deviation is commonly used because it is in the same units as the data and provides insight \n",
    "into the variability of the dataset.\n",
    "   - Example: In a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, about 68% of the data points lie within \n",
