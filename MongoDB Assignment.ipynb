    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON \n",
    "(Binary JSON). It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, making it suitable \n",
    "for applications where data structure may evolve over time. MongoDB is known for its scalability, performance, and \n",
    "ease of use, allowing developers to work with complex data types and relationships without a rigid schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Relational Databases\n",
    "Non-relational databases (often referred to as NoSQL databases) are designed to provide flexible data storage and \n",
    "retrieval mechanisms that do not rely on a fixed schema like traditional relational databases. They can handle a \n",
    "variety of data formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, and graph structures. Non-relational\n",
    "databases prioritize scalability and flexibility over strict data integrity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios to Prefer MongoDB Over SQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic Schema: If your application requires a flexible schema that can evolve without significant downtime or \n",
    "    migrations (e.g., evolving data structures), MongoDB is a better choice.\n",
    "2. Large Volumes of Unstructured Data: For applications dealing with large datasets that do not fit well into a table \n",
    "    format, such as social media data, logs, or multimedia files, MongoDB can efficiently store and manage this type of\n",
    "    information.\n",
    "3. High Write Loads: MongoDB is designed to handle high write loads, making it suitable for applications like real-time\n",
    "    analytics, IoT data collection, and content management systems.\n",
    "4. Scalability Needs: If you expect rapid growth in data or traffic, MongoDB’s ability to scale horizontally across \n",
    "    multiple servers allows for easier management of increasing loads compared to traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "5. Geographically Distributed Data: If your application requires data to be spread across multiple locations for \n",
    "    low-latency access, MongoDB’s built-in support for sharding and replication is beneficial.\n",
    "6. Complex Data Types: MongoDB can easily handle complex data structures (like arrays and nested documents) without \n",
    "    the need for complex joins or additional tables, which can simplify application development."

    "1. Flexible Schema\n",
    "- Explanation: MongoDB uses a schema-less data model, allowing for documents within the same collection to have \n",
    "    different structures. This flexibility enables developers to adapt to changing requirements without needing \n",
    "    extensive migrations or downtime.\n",
    "2. Document-Oriented Storage\n",
    "- Explanation: Data in MongoDB is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which allows for rich data types, including \n",
    "    nested documents and arrays. This structure makes it easy to represent complex data relationships.\n",
    "3. Scalability\n",
    "- Horizontal Scaling: MongoDB supports sharding, which allows data to be distributed across multiple servers. This \n",
    "    capability enables the database to scale out easily and handle large volumes of traffic and data.\n",
    "4. High Performance\n",
    "- Explanation: MongoDB is optimized for high-speed read and write operations. Its memory-mapped storage engine allows\n",
    "    for efficient use of RAM, resulting in faster data access and processing.\n",
    "5. Rich Query Language\n",
    "- Explanation: MongoDB provides a powerful and expressive query language that supports a variety of operations, \n",
    "    including filtering, sorting, and aggregation. It also supports indexing to enhance query performance.\n",
    "6. Aggregation Framework\n",
    "- Explanation: The aggregation framework in MongoDB allows for data processing and transformation in a flexible manner. \n",
    "    It supports operations like grouping, filtering, and reshaping data, enabling complex data analysis.\n",
    "7. Replication and High Availability\n",
    "- Explanation: MongoDB supports replica sets, which are groups of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set. \n",
    "    This feature ensures high availability and data redundancy, allowing automatic failover if a primary server goes \n",
    "    down.\n",

    "    string content within documents. This is useful for applications that require search functionalities.\n",
    "10. Geospatial Indexing\n",
    "- Explanation: MongoDB supports geospatial queries and indexing, making it suitable for applications that require \n",
    "    location-based services, such as mapping or location tracking."
