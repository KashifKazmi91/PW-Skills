    "\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "  - Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (e.g., flipping a coin).\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "  - Represents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant mean rate and \n",
    "independence of events (e.g., phone call arrivals at a call center).\n",
    "- Geometric Distribution:\n",
    "  - Models the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "- Negative Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "  - Extends the geometric distribution to model the number of trials required to achieve a specified number of \n",
    "successes.\n",
    "- Hypergeometric Distribution:\n",
    "  - Models the number of successes in a sequence of draws without replacement from a finite population.\n",

    "2. Continuous Probability Distributions\n",
    "Continuous probability distributions are used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a \n",

    "- Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):\n",
    "  - Characterized by its bell-shaped curve, defined by its mean and standard deviation. It describes many natural \n",
    "phenomena (e.g., heights, test scores).\n",
    "- Uniform Distribution:\n",
    "  - All outcomes in a specified range are equally likely (e.g., rolling a fair die).\n",
    "- Exponential Distribution:\n",
    "  - Describes the time between events in a Poisson process, characterized by its rate parameter (e.g., time until a \n",
    "radioactive particle decays).\n",
    "- Log-Normal Distribution:\n",
    "  - If a random variable is normally distributed when its logarithm is taken, it follows a log-normal distribution. \n",
    "Often used in finance for modeling stock prices.\n",
    "- Chi-Squared Distribution:\n",
    "  - Used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation, particularly in tests of goodness of fit and \n",
    "independence.\n",
    "- Student's t-Distribution:\n",
    "  - Similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails, useful for estimating population parameters when the \n",
    "sample size is small."

    "1. Nature of Trials\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "  - Involves a fixed number of trials (n)\n",
    "  - Each trial has two possible outcomes: success or failure\n",
    "  - The probability of success (p) is constant for each trial\n",

    "- Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "  - Typically used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "  - Does not have a fixed number of trials; instead, it is defined by the average rate of occurrence (lambda).\n",
    "  - Assumes that events occur independently and are uniformly distributed over time or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parameters\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "  - Defined by two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "  - Defined by a single parameter (lambda) (the average number of events in the interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Applications\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "  - Used when the number of trials is fixed and the outcome is binary (e.g., flipping a coin a certain number of times, \n",
    "quality control in manufacturing).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "  - Used for modeling the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval (e.g., number of phone calls received at \n",
    "a call center in an hour, number of decay events per unit time from a radioactive source).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Distribution Shape\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "  - Can take various shapes depending on (n) and (p). It can be symmetric (when (p = 0.5)) or skewed (when (p < 0.5) \n",
    "or (p > 0.5)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "  - Generally skewed, especially for smaller values of (lambda). As (lambda) increases, the distribution approaches a \n",
    "normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Limitations\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "  - Requires the number of trials to be fixed and independent with a constant probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution:\n",
    "  - Assumes events are rare and independent, and can be approximated using a binomial distribution when (n) is large \n",
