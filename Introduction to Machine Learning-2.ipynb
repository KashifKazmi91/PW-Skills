    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the underlying patterns in the \n",

    "    training set but poorly on unseen data (test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consequences**:\n",
    "- **Poor Generalization**: The model does not perform well on new, unseen data because it has essentially \n",
    "    memorized the training data instead of learning to generalize.\n",
    "- **Increased Complexity**: Overfitted models can become overly complex, making them less interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies**:\n",
    "1. **Simplifying the Model**: Use a less complex model with fewer parameters.\n",
    "2. **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization add penalties for large coefficients, \n",
    "    discouraging complexity.\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different\n",
    "    subsets of data.\n",
    "4. **Pruning**: In decision trees, pruning techniques can remove branches that provide little predictive power.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Common Regularization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**:\n",
    "   - **Mechanism**: Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the coefficients (weights) to the loss function.\n",
